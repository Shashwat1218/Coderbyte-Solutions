## Question: LongestWord

The **LongestWord** function takes a string (`sen`) as input and returns the longest word in the string. If there are multiple words of the same length, it returns the first word encountered with that length. Punctuation is ignored, and the function assumes `sen` will not be empty. Words may also contain numbers.

### Example

For example, given the input `"fun&!! time"`, the function should return `"time"`.
